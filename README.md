This template system extends [Semantic.gs](http://semantic.gs) to make it more usable on sites where:

- you'd prefer a fixed grid but would like it to be fluid under certain circumstances (on mobile or print views, for instance)
- you'd like to customize the layout for different breakpoints, by specifying whether boxes resize or reflow

System designed specifically for [IEEE Spectrum](http://spectrum.ieee.org) but it's not particularly opinionated.

Currently forked from Semantic.gs v 1.2.
